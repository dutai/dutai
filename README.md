I am currently focused on refining my skills in C programming, deepening my understanding of the
language to build efficient and robust applications. Alongside C, I have a strong command of Python
and JavaScript, which I use to create dynamic and interactive web applications. My experience in web
development includes mastering foundational techniques that allow me to build responsive and
user-friendly websites.
